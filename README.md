# AML Detection using Machine Learning

#1.  Introduction
Money laundering is a significant financial crime involving the process of making illicitly obtained money appear to come from a legitimate source. Our project aims to address this issue by creating an automated Anti-Money Laundering (AML) detection product using Machine Learning (ML). The goal is to develop a clean and streamlined solution that adheres to the latest MLOps recommendations and procedures learned in the IE7374 Machine Learning Operations course at Northeastern University, under the guidance of Prof. Ramin Mohammadi.

Project Scope
End-to-End Automation:

Develop an end-to-end automated product incorporating Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment (CD), Continuous Testing (CT), and Configuration Management (CM).
