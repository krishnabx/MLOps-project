# AML Detection using Machine Learning

1.  Introduction
Money laundering is a significant financial crime involving the process of making illicitly obtained money appear to come from a legitimate source. Our project aims to address this issue by creating an automated Anti-Money Laundering (AML) detection product using Machine Learning (ML). The goal is to develop a clean and streamlined solution that adheres to the latest MLOps recommendations and procedures learned in the IE7374 Machine Learning Operations course at Northeastern University, under the guidance of Prof. Ramin Mohammadi.

**Project Scope**
-End-to-End Automation: Develop an end-to-end automated product incorporating Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment (CD), Continuous Testing (CT), and Configuration Management (CM).

-Reference and Enhancements: Use Capital One's project as a reference and compare our solution against it. Explore potential enhancements to further improve AML detection.

2. Dataset Introduction

The dataset used for our AML detection project consists of financial transactions, including bank transfers and credit card transactions. The dataset is synthetically generated by IBM using a multi-agent virtual world model. It comprises two categories:

LI: Lower Illicit Ratio (Less Laundering)
HI: High Illicit Ratio (High Laundering)
For each category, datasets are available in three sizes:

Small: 5 million transaction records
Medium: 30 million records
Large: 180 million records
